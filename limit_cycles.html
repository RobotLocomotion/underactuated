<chapter style="counter-reset: chapter 15"><h1>Algorithms
for Limit Cycles</h1>

  <p>The discussion of walking and running robots in Chapter 4 motivated the
  notion of limit cycle stability.  Linear systems are not capable of producing
  stable limit cycle behavior, so this rich topic is unique to nonlinear systems
  design and analysis.  Furthermore, the tools that are required to design,
  stabilize, and verify limit cycles will have applicability beyond simple
  periodic motions.</p>

  <p>The first natural question we must ask is, given a system $\dot{\bx} =
  f(\bx)$, or a control system $\dot{x} = f(\bx,\bu)$, how do we go about
  finding periodic solutions which may be passively stable, open-loop stable, or
  stabilized with closed-loop feedback? It turns out that the trajectory
  optimization tools that we developed in the last chapter are very well suited
  to this task.</p>

  <section><h1>Trajectory optimization</h1>

    <p>I introduced the trajectory optimization tools as means for optimizing a
    single trajectory of the system from a particular known initial condition.
    But they can be used in a slightly different way, too -- in some
    formulations we might choose to have the initial conditions as one of the
    decision variables.  In fact, the simplest formulation for finding a
    periodic solution is to leave the entire trajectory as a decision variable,
    but to add <em>periodicity constraints</em> enforcing that the initial
    conditions and the final conditions match.  Some care is needed here; if
    you're not careful then these constraints will all be met if the entire
    trajectory remains at a fixed point in the system.  In the example below, we
    constrain that the initial and final conditions lie on the surface of
    section that we used before, and additionally constrain that the velocity at
    the initial/final points is non-zero (to avoid the fixed point
    solution).</p>

    <p>Note that although we introduced trajectory optimization as searching
    over control inputs $\bu$, this formulation is now rich enough that it
    solves an important problem even for passive systems -- with no control
    input at all.</p>

    <example><h1>Finding the limit cycle of the
    Van der Pol oscillator</h1>

      <p>Recall the dynamics of the Van der Pol oscillator given by $$\ddot{q} +
      \mu (q^2 - 1) \dot{q} + q = 0, \quad \mu>0,$$ which exhibited a stable
      limit cycle.</p>

      <p>Formulate the direct collocation optimization:
        \begin{align*}
          \find_{\bx_0,...,\bx_N,dt} \quad \\
          \subjto \quad    & q_0 = 0, \quad \dot{q}_0 > 0, \\
          & \bx_N = \bx_0, \text{(periodicity constraint)}\\
          & \text{collocation dynamic constraints}
        \end{align*}
      </p>

      <p>Try it yourself:</p>
        <pysrc>van_der_pol/dircol.py</pysrc>

      <p>As always, make sure that you take a look at the code.  Poke around.
      Try changing some things.</p>

      <p>One of the things that you should notice in the code is that I provide
      an initial guess for the solver.  In most of the examples so far I've been
      able to avoid doing that--the solver takes small random numbers as a
      default initial guess and solves from there.  But for this problem, I
      found that it was getting stuck in a local minima.  Adding the initial
      guess that the solution moves around a circle in state space was enough.

  <section><h1>Lyapunov analysis</h1>

    <p>Recall the important distinction between stability of a trajectory in
    time and   stability of a limit cycle was that the limit cycle does not
    converge in phase --   trajectories near the cycle converge to the cycle,
    but trajectories on the cycle   may not converge with each other.  This is
    type of stability, also known as <em>orbital   stability</em> can be written
    as stability to the manifold described by cycle   $\bx^*(t)$, \[ \min_\tau
    || x(t) - x^*(\tau) || \rightarrow 0.\] In the case of limit cycles, this
    manifold is a periodic solution with $\bx^*(t+t_{period}) = \bx^*(t)$.
    Depending on exactly how that convergence happens, we can define orbital
    stability in the sense of Lyapunov, asymptotic orbital stability,
    exponential orbital stability, or even finite-time orbital stability.</p>

    <p>In order to prove that a system is orbitally stable (locally, over a
    region, or globally), or to analyze the region of attraction of a limit
    cycle, we can use a Lyapunov function. In particular, we would like to
    consider Lyapunov functions which have the form cartooned below;  they
    vanish to zero everywhere along the cycle, and are strictly positive
    everywhere away from the cycle.</p>

    <figure><img
    src="figures/limitCycleLyapunovCartoon.svg"/><figcaption>Cartoon of a
    Lyapunov function which vanishes on a limit cycle, and is strictly positive
    everywhere else. (a small segment has been removed solely for the purposes
    of visualization).</figcaption></figure>

    <subsection><h1>Transverse coordinates</h1>

      <p>How can we parameterize this class of functions?  For arbitrary cycles
      this could be very difficult in the original coordinates.  For simple
      cycles like in the cartoon, one could imagine using polar coordinates.
      More generally, we will define a new coordinate system relative to the
      orbit, with coordinates</p> <ul> <li>$\tau$ - the phase along the
      orbit</li> <li>$\bx_\perp(\tau)$ - the remaining coordinates, linearly
      independent from $\tau$.</li> </ul> <p>Given a state $\bx$ in the original
      coordinates, we must define a smooth mapping $\bx \rightarrow (\tau,
      \bx_\perp)$ to this new coordinate system.  For example, for a simple ring
      oscillator we might have:</p> <figure><img width="80%"
      src="figures/transverseCoordinates.svg"/><figcaption>A moving
      coordinate system along the limit cycle.</figcaption></figure> In general,
      for an $n$-dimensional state space, $\tau$ will always be a scalar, and
      $\bx_\perp$ will be an $(n-1)$-dimensional vector defining the remaining
      coordinates relative to $\bx^*(\tau)$. In fact, although we use the
      notation $\bx_\perp$ the coordinate system need not be strictly orthogonal
      to the orbit, but must simply be <em>transversal</em> (not parallel).
      Having defined the smooth mapping $\bx \rightarrow (\tau,\bx_\perp)$, we
      can always rewrite the dynamics in this new coordinate system:
      \begin{gather*} \dot{\tau} = f_1(\bx_\perp,\tau) \\ \dot\bx_\perp =
      f_2(\bx_\perp,\tau). \end{gather*} <p>The value of this construction for
      Lyapunov analysis was proposed in <elib>Hauser94a</elib> and has been
      extended nicely to control design in <elib>Shiriaev08</elib> and for
      region of attraction estimation in <elib>Manchester10b</elib>.  A
      particular numerical strategy for defining the transversal coordinates is
      given in <elib>Manchester10a</elib>.</p>

      <theorem><h1>A Lyapunov theorem for orbital stability</h1>

        <p>For a dynamical system $\dot\bx = f(\bx)$ with $\bx \in \Re^n$, $f$
        continuous, a continuous periodic solution $\bx^*(\tau)$, and a smooth
        mapping $\bx \rightarrow (\tau,\bx_\perp)$ where $\bx_\perp$ vanishes on
        $\bx^*$, then for some $n-1$ dimensional ball ${\cal B}$ around the
        origin, if I can produce a $V(\bx_\perp,\tau)$ such that \begin{gather*}
        \forall \tau, V(0,\tau) = 0, \\ \forall \tau, \forall \bx_\perp \in
        {\cal B}, \bx_\perp \ne 0, V(\bx_\perp,\tau) > 0, \end{gather*} with
        \begin{gather*} \forall \tau, \dot{V}(0,\tau) = 0, \\ \forall \tau,
        \forall \bx_\perp \in {\cal B}, \bx_\perp \ne 0, \dot{V}(\bx_\perp,\tau)
        < 0, \end{gather*} then the solution $\bx^*(t)$ is <em>locally orbitally
        asymptotically stable</em>.</p>

      </theorem>

      <example><h1>Simple ring oscillator</h1>

        <p> Perhaps the simplest oscillator is the first-order system which
        converges to the unit circle.   In cartesian coordinates, the dynamics
        are   \begin{align*} \dot{x}_1 =& x_2 -\alpha x_1 \left( 1 -
        \frac{1}{\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}}\right) \\ \dot{x}_2 =& -x_1 -\alpha x_2
        \left( 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}}\right), \end{align*}   where
        $\alpha$ is a positive scalar gain.</p>

        <figure><img width=80%
        src="figures/ringOscillator.svg"/><figcaption>Vector field of the
        ring oscillator</figcaption></figure>

        <p>If we take the transverse coordinates to be the polar coordinates,
        shifted so that $x_\perp$ is zero on the unit circle, \begin{align*}\tau
        =& \text{atan2}(-x_2,x_1) \\ x_\perp =& \sqrt{x_1^2+x_2^2}-1,
        \end{align*} which is valid when $x_\perp>-1$, then the simple
        transverse dynamics are revealed:   \begin{align*}     \dot\tau =& 1 \\
        \dot{x}_\perp =& -\alpha x_\perp.   \end{align*}   Taking a Lyapunov
        candidate $V(x_\perp,\tau) = x_\perp^2$, we can verify that $$\dot{V} =
        -2 \alpha x_\perp^2 \prec 0, \quad \forall x_\perp > -1.$$ This
        demonstrates that the limit cycle is locally asymptotically stable, and
        furthermore that the invariant open-set $V < 1$ is inside the region of
        attraction of that limit cycle. In fact, we know that all $x_\perp > -1$
        are in the region of attraction that limit cycle, but this is not proven
        by the Lyapunov argument above. </p>

      </example>

      <p>Let's compare this approach with the approach that we used in the
      chapter on walking robots, where we used a Poincar&eacute map analysis to
      investigate limit cycle stability. In transverse coordinates approach,
      there is an additional burden to construct the coordinate system along the
      entire trajectory, instead of only at a single surface of section.  In
      fact, the transverse coordinates approach is sometimes referred to as a
      "moving Poincar&eacute section". But the reward for this extra work is
      that we can check a condition that only involves the instantaneous
      dynamics, $f(\bx)$, as opposed to having to integrate the dynamics over an
      entire cycle to generate the discrete Poincar&eacute map, $\bx_p[n+1] =
      P(\bx_p[n])$. While computing $P$ in closed-form happened to be possible
      for the simple rimless wheel model, it is rarely possible for more complex
      models.  As we will see below, this approach will also be more compatible
      with designing continuous feedback controller that stabilize the limit
      cycle.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Transverse linearization</h1>

      <p>In the case of Lyapunov analysis around a fixed point, there was an
      important special case: for stable linear systems, we actually have a
      recipe for constructing a Lyapunov function.  As a result, for nonlinear
      systems, we often found it convenient to begin our search by linearizing
      around the fixed point and using the Lyapunov candidate for the linear
      system as an initial guess.  That same approach can be extended to limit
      cycle analysis.</p>
