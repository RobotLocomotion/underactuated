<section id="preface"><h1>Preface</h1>

  <p>This book is about building robots that move with speed, efficiency, and
  grace.  I believe that this can only be achieve through a tight coupling
  between mechanical design, passive dynamics, and nonlinear control synthesis.
  Therefore, these notes contain selected material from dynamical systems
  theory, as well as linear and nonlinear control.<p>

  <p>These notes also reflect a deep belief in computational algorithms playing
  an essential role in finding and optimizing solutions to complex dynamics and
  control problems.  Algorithms play an increasingly central role in modern
  control theory; these days even rigorous mathematicians consider finding
  convexity in a problem (therefore making it amenable to an efficient
  computational solution) almost tantamount to an analytical result.  Therefore,
  the notes necessarily also cover selected material from optimization theory,
  motion planning, and machine learning.</p>

  <p> Although the material in the book comes from many sources, the
  presentation is targeted very specifically at a handful of robotics problems.
  Concepts are introduced only when and if they can help progress the
  capabilities we are trying to develop.  Many of the disciplines that I am
  drawing from are traditionally very rigorous, to the point where the basic
  ideas can be hard to penetrate for someone that is new to the field. I've made
  a conscious effort in these notes to keep a very informal, conversational tone
  even when introducing these rigorous topics, and to reference the most
  powerful theorems but only to prove them when that proof would add particular
  insights without distracting from the mainstream presentation.  I hope that
  the result is a broad but reasonably self-contained and readable manuscript
  that will be of use to any enthusiastic roboticist.</p>

  <section><h1>Organization</h1>

    <p>The material in these notes is organized into a few main parts. "Model
    Systems" introduces a series of increasingly complex dynamical systems and
    overviews some of the relevant results from the literature for each system.
    "Nonlinear Planning and Control" introduces quite general computational
    algorithms for reasoning about those dynamical systems, with optimization
    theory playing a central role. Many of these algorithms treat the dynamical
    system as known and deterministic until the last chapters in this part which
    introduce stochasticity and robustness.  "Estimation and Learning" follows
    this up with techniques from statistics and machine learning which
    capitalize on this viewpoint to introduce additional algorithms which can
    operate with less assumptions on knowing the model or having perfect
    sensors.  The book closes with an "Appendix" that provides slightly more
    introduction (and references) for the main topics used in the course.</p>

    <p>The order of the chapters was chosen to make the book valuable as a
    reference.  When teaching the course, however, I take a spiral trajectory
    through the material, introducing robot dynamics and control problems one at
    a time, and introducing only the techniques that are required to solve that
    particular problem.</p>

    cp/acro -> walking ...  with chapter numbers associated.</todo>

  <section><h1>Software</h1>

    <p> All of the examples and algorithms in this book, plus many more, are now
    available as a part of our open-source software project: <drake></drake>.
    <drake></drake> is a C++ project, but in this text we will use Drake's <a
    href="http://drake.mit.edu/python_bindings.html">Python bindings</a>.  I
    encourage super-users or readers who want to dig deeper to explore the C++
    code as well (and to contribute back). </p>

    <p>Please see the <a href="drake.html">appendix</a>
    for specific instructions for using <drake></drake> along with these
    notes.</p>
