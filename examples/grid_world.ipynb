The only difference is that this agent is allowed to move diagonally in a single step; this is slightly easier to code since I can have two actions (one for left/right, and another for up/down), and write the dynamics as the trivial linear system ${\\bf x}[n+1] = {\\bf u}[n].$  Only the value iteration code needs to know that the states and actions are actually restricted to the integers.\n",
