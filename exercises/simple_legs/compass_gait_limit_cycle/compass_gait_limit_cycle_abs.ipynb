    "In this exercise we will write a nonlinear optimization to find the limit cycle of the passive compass gait.\n",
    "We have already discussed this problem in the [lecture notes](http://underactuated.mit.edu/simple_legs.html#compass_gait) under some simplifying assumptions (the stance foot acts as a pin joint does not slip, we disregarded firction limits in the heel strike).\n",
    "In the case of the rimless wheel, we have also seen how to use `DirectCollocation` to [detect the limit cycle under these simplifying assumptions](https://github.com/RussTedrake/underactuated/blob/master/underactuated/rimless_wheel/dircol_limitcycle.py).\n",
    "In this notebook we take a more general approach, that can be used as a starting point to derive limit cycles for more complex robots, like the [kneed walker](http://underactuated.mit.edu/simple_legs.html#kneed_walker) or even 3D robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start from the `urdf` description of the compass gait: no derivation of the equations of motion by hand here.\n",
    "We describe the system in floting-base coordinates, meaning that the position of the stance foot is not fixed and is included in the configuration vector $\\mathbf{q}$.\n",
    "We then parse the `urdf` to obtain the manipulator equations for the compass gait, together with the Jacobian matrices needed to take care of contacts and no-penetration constraints.\n",
    "Finally, we write a `MathematicalProgram` to identify the limit cycle.\n",
    "This is a different kind of trajectory optimization from the ones you have been seen before: there is no control action to optimize this time, the only knob we have is the initial state of the compass gait.\n",
    "We do not even have a cost function to minimize.\n",
