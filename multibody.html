  <section><h1>Deriving the equations of motion (an example)</h1>

    <p>The equations of motion for a standard robot can be derived using the
    method of Lagrange.  Using $T$ as the total kinetic energy of the system,
    and $U$ as the total potential energy of the system, $L = T-U$, and $Q_i$ as
    the generalized force corresponding to $q_i$, the Lagrangian dynamic
    equations are: \begin{equation} \frac{d}{dt}\pd{L}{\dot{q}_i} - \pd{L}{q_i}
    = Q_i.\end{equation} If you are not comfortable with these equations, then
    any good book chapter on rigid body mechanics can bring you up to speed --
    try <elib>Craig89</elib> for a very practical guide to robot
    kinematics/dynamics, <elib>Goldstein02</elib> for a more hard-core dynamics
    text or <elib>Thornton03</elib> for a classical dynamics text which is a
    nice read -- for now you can take them as a handle that you can crank to
    generate equations of motion. </p>

    <example><h1>Simple Double Pendulum</h1>

      <figure>
        <img style="width:250px;" src="figures/simple_double_pend.svg"/>
        <figcaption>Simple double pendulum</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p> Consider the simple double pendulum with torque actuation at both
      joints and all of the mass concentrated in two points (for simplicity).
      Using $\bq = [\theta_1,\theta_2]^T$, and ${\bf p}_1,{\bf p}_2$ to denote
      the locations of $m_1,m_2$, respectively, the kinematics of this system
      are:

      \begin{eqnarray*}
      {\bf p}_1 =& l_1\begin{bmatrix} s_1 \\ - c_1 \end{bmatrix}, &{\bf p}_2  =
      {\bf p}_1 + l_2\begin{bmatrix} s_{1+2} \\ - c_{1+2} \end{bmatrix} \\
      \dot{{\bf p}}_1 =& l_1 \dot{q}_1\begin{bmatrix} c_1 \\ s_1 \end{bmatrix},
      &\dot{{\bf p}}_2 = \dot{{\bf p}}_1 + l_2 (\dot{q}_1+\dot{q}_2) \begin{bmatrix} c_{1+2} \\ s_{1+2} \end{bmatrix}
      \end{eqnarray*}

      Note that $s_1$ is shorthand for $\sin(q_1)$, $c_{1+2}$ is shorthand for
      $\cos(q_1+q_2)$, etc. From this we can write the kinetic and potential
      energy:

      \begin{align*}
      T =& \frac{1}{2} m_1 \dot{\bf p}_1^T \dot{\bf p}_1 + \frac{1}{2} m_2
      \dot{\bf p}_2^T \dot{\bf p}_2 \\
      =& \frac{1}{2}(m_1 + m_2) l_1^2 \dot{q}_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 l_2^2 (\dot{q}_1 + \dot{q}_2)^2 + m_2 l_1 l_2 \dot{q}_1 (\dot{q}_1 + \dot{q}_2) c_2 \\
      U =& m_1 g y_1 + m_2 g y_2 = -(m_1+m_2) g l_1 c_1 - m_2 g l_2 c_{1+2}
      \end{align*}

      Taking the partial derivatives $\pd{T}{q_i}$, $\pd{T}{\dot{q}_i}$, and
      $\pd{U}{q_i}$ ($\pd{U}{\dot{q}_i}$ terms are always zero), then
      $\frac{d}{dt}\pd{T}{\dot{q}_i}$, and plugging them into the Lagrangian,
      reveals the equations of motion:

      \begin{align*}
      (m_1 + m_2) l_1^2 \ddot{q}_1& + m_2 l_2^2 (\ddot{q}_1 + \ddot{q}_2) + m_2 l_1 l_2 (2 \ddot{q}_1 + \ddot{q}_2) c_2 \\
      &- m_2 l_1 l_2 (2 \dot{q}_1 + \dot{q}_2) \dot{q}_2 s_2 + (m_1 + m_2) l_1 g s_1 + m_2 g l_2 s_{1+2} = \tau_1 \\
      m_2 l_2^2 (\ddot{q}_1 + \ddot{q}_2)& + m_2 l_1 l_2 \ddot{q}_1 c_2 + m_2 l_1 l_2
      \dot{q}_1^2 s_2 + m_2 g l_2 s_{1+2} = \tau_2
      \end{align*}

      As we saw in chapter 1, numerically integrating (and animating) these
      equations in <drake></drake> produces the expected result. </p>

  <section><h1>The Manipulator Equations</h1>

    <p> If you crank through the Lagrangian dynamics for a few simple robotic
    manipulators, you will begin to see a pattern emerge - the resulting
    equations of motion all have a characteristic form.  For example, the
    kinetic energy of your robot can always be written in the form:
    \begin{equation} T = \frac{1}{2} \dot{\bq}^T \bM(\bq)
    \dot{\bq},\end{equation} where $\bM$ is the state-dependent inertia matrix
    (aka mass matrix). This observation affords some insight into general
    manipulator dynamics - for example we know that ${\bf M}$ is always positive
    definite, and symmetric<elib>Asada86</elib>(p.107) and has a beautiful
    sparsity pattern<elib>Featherstone05</elib> that we'll attempt to take
    advantage of in our algorithms.</p>


    <p>Continuing our abstractions, we find that the equations of motion of a
    general robotic manipulator (without kinematic loops) take the form
    \begin{equation}{\bf M}(\bq)\ddot{\bq} + \bC(\bq,\dot{\bq})\dot{\bq} =
    \btau_g(\bq) + {\bf B}\bu, \label{eq:manip} \end{equation} where $\bq$ is
    the joint position vector, ${\bf M}$ is the inertia matrix, $\bC$ captures
    Coriolis forces, and $\btau_g$ is the gravity vector.  The matrix $\bB$ maps
    control inputs $\bu$ into generalized forces.  Note that we pair
    $\bM\ddot\bq + \bC\dot\bq$ on the left side because "... the equations of
    motion depend on the choice of coordinates $\bq$.  For this reason neither
    $\bM\ddot\bq$ nor $\bC\dot\bq$ individually should be thought of as a
    generalized force; only their sum is a force"<elib>Choset05</elib>(s.10.2).
    Indeed, whenever I write Eq. (\ref{eq:manip}), I see $ma = F$. </p>

    <example id="manipulator_equation_double_pendulum"><h1>Manipulator Equation form of the Simple Double
    Pendulum</h1> The equations of motion from Example 1 can be written
    compactly as: \begin{align*} \bM(\bq) =& \begin{bmatrix} (m_1 + m_2)l_1^2 +
    m_2 l_2^2 + 2 m_2 l_1l_2 c_2 & m_2 l_2^2 + m_2 l_1 l_2 c_2 \\ m_2 l_2^2 +
    m_2 l_1 l_2 c_2 & m_2 l_2^2 \end{bmatrix} \\ \bC(\bq,\dot\bq) =&
    \begin{bmatrix} 0 & -m_2 l_1 l_2 (2\dot{q}_1 + \dot{q}_2)s_2 \\ m_2 l_1 l_2
    \dot{q}_1 s_2 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \\ \btau_g(\bq) =& -g \begin{bmatrix} (m_1 +
    m_2) l_1 s_1 + m_2 l_2 s_{1+2} \\ m_2 l_2 s_{1+2} \end{bmatrix} , \quad \bB
    = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \end{align*} Note that this
    choice of the $\bC$ matrix was not unique. </example>

    <p> The manipulator equations are very general, but they do define some
    important characteristics.  For example, $\ddot{\bq}$ is (state-dependent)
    linearly related to the control input, $\bu$.   This observation justifies
    the control-affine form of the dynamics assumed throughout the notes.</p>

    <p>Note that we have chosen to use the notation of second-order systems
    (with $\dot{\bq}$ and $\ddot{\bq}$ appearing in the equations) throughout
    this book.  Although I believe it provides more clarity, there is an
    important limitation to this notation: it is impossible to describe 3D
    rotations in "minimal coordinates" using this notation without introducing
    kinematic singularities (like the famous "gimbal lock"). For instance, a
    common singularity-free choice for representing a 3D rotation is the unit
    quaternion, described by 4 real values (plus a norm constraint).  However we
    can still represent the rotational velocity without singularities using just
    3 real values.  This means that the length of our velocity vector is no
    longer the same as the length of our position vector.  For this reason, you
    will see that most of the software in <drake></drake> uses the more general
    notation with $\bv$ to represent velocity, $\bq$ to represent positions, and
    the manipulator equations are written as \begin{equation} \bM(\bq) \dot{\bv}
    + \bC(\bq,\bv)\bv = \btau_g(\bq) + \bB \bu, \end{equation} which is
    not necessarily a second-order system.  See <elib>Duindam06</elib> for a
    nice discussion of this topic.</p>

    <subsection><h1>Bilateral Position Constraints</h1>

      <p>If our robot has closed-kinematic chains, for instance those that arise
      from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-bar_linkage">four-bar
      linkage</a>, then we need a little more.  The Lagrangian machinery above
      assumes "minimal coordinates"; if our state vector $\bq$ contains all of
      the links in the kinematic chain, then we do not have a minimal
      parameterization -- each kinematic loop adds (at least) one constraint so
      should remove (at least) one degree of freedom.  Although some constraints
      can be solved away, the more general solution is to use the Lagrangian to
      derive the dynamics of the unconstrained system (a kinematic tree without
      the closed-loop constraints), then add additional generalized forces that
      ensure that the constraint is always satisfied. </p>

      <p>Consider the constraint equation \begin{equation}\bh(\bq) =
      0.\end{equation}  For the case of the kinematic closed-chain, this can be
      the kinematic constraint that the location of one end of the chain is
      equal to the location of the other end of the chain. The equations of
      motion can be written \begin{equation}\bM({\bq})\ddot{\bq} +
      \bC(\bq,\dot{\bq})\dot\bq = \btau_g(\bq) + \bB\bu + \bH^T(\bq)
      \blambda,\end{equation} where $\bH(\bq) = \pd\bh{\bq}$ and ${\blambda}$ is
      the constraint force.  Let's use the shorthand \begin{equation}
      \bM({\bq})\ddot{\bq} = \btau(q,\dot{q},u) + \bH^T(\bq) \blambda.
      \label{eq:manip_short} \end{equation}</p>

      <p>Using \begin{gather}\dot\bh = \bH\dot\bq,\\ \ddot\bh = \bH \ddot\bq +
      \dot\bH \dot\bq, \label{eq:ddoth} \end{gather} we can solve for
      $\blambda$, by observing that when the constraint is imposed, $\bh=0$ and
      therefore $\dot\bh=0$ and $\ddot\bh=0$.  Inserting the dynamics
      (\ref{eq:manip_short}) into (\ref{eq:ddoth}) yields
      \begin{equation}\blambda =- (\bH \bM^{-1} \bH^T)^+ (\bH \bM^{-1} \btau +
      \dot\bH\dot\bq).\end{equation} The $^+$ notation refers to a Moore-Penrose
      pseudo-inverse.  In many cases, this matrix will be full rank (for
      instance, in the case of multiple independent four-bar linkages) and the
      traditional inverse could have been used.  When the matrix drops rank
      (multiple solutions), then the pseudo-inverse will select the solution
      with the smallest constraint forces in the least-squares sense.</p>

      <p>To combat numerical "constraint drift", one might like to add a
      restoring force in the event that the constraint is not satisfied to
      numerical precision.  To accomplish this, rather than solving for
      $\ddot\bh = 0$ as above, we can instead solve for \begin{equation}\ddot\bh
      = \bH\ddot\bq + \dot\bH\dot\bq = -2\alpha \dot\bh - \alpha^2
      \bh,\end{equation} where $\alpha>0$ is a stiffness parameter. This is
      known as Baumgarte's stabilization technique, implemented here with a
      single parameter to provide a critically-damped response.
      Carrying
      this through yields \begin{equation} \blambda =- (\bH \bM^{-1} \bH^T)^+
      (\bH \bM^{-1} \btau + (\dot{\bH} + 2\alpha \bH)\dot{\bq} + \alpha^2 \bh).
      \end{equation}</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Bilateral Velocity Constraints</h1>

      <p>Consider the constraint equation \begin{equation}\bh_v(\bq,\dot{\bq}) =
      0,\end{equation} where $\pd{\bh_v}{\dot{\bq}} \ne 0.$  These are less
      common, but arise when, for instance, a joint is driven through a
      prescribed motion. Here, the manipulator equations are given by
      \begin{equation}\bM\ddot{\bq}  = \btau + \pd{\bh_v}{\dot{\bq}}^T
      \blambda.\end{equation} Using \begin{equation} \dot\bh_v = \pd{\bh_v}{\bq}
      \dot{\bq} + \pd{\bh_v}{\dot{\bq}}\ddot{\bq},\end{equation} setting
      $\dot\bh_v = 0$ yields \begin{equation}\blambda = - \left(
      \pd{\bh_v}{\dot{\bq}} \bM^{-1} \pd{\bh_v}{\dot{\bq}} \right)^+ \left[
      \pd{\bh_v}{\dot{\bq}} \bM^{-1} \btau + \pd{\bh_v}{\bq} \dot{\bq}
      \right].\end{equation}</p>

      <p>Again, to combat constraint drift, we can ask instead for $\dot\bh_v =
      -\alpha \bh_v$, which yields \begin{equation}\blambda = - \left(
      \pd{\bh_v}{\dot{\bq}} \bM^{-1} \pd{\bh_v}{\dot{\bq}} \right)^+ \left[
      \pd{\bh_v}{\dot{\bq}} \bM^{-1} \btau + \pd{\bh_v}{\bq} \dot{\bq} + \alpha
      \bh_v \right].\end{equation}</p>

  <section><h1>Contact Models</h1>

    <p>Now let $\phi(\bq)$ indicate the relative (signed) distance between
      two rigid bodies.  For rigid contact, we would like to enforce the
      unilateral constraint: \begin{equation} \phi(\bq) \geq 0.
      \end{equation}</p>

    <p>There are three main approaches used to modeling contact with "rigid"
    body systems:  1) rigid contact approximated with stiff compliant contact,
    2) hybrid models with collision event detection, impulsive reset maps, and
    continuous (constrained) dynamics between collision events, and 3) rigid
    contact approximated with time-averaged forces (time-stepping).  Each
    modeling approach has advantages/disadvantages for different
    applications...</p>

    <subsection><h1>Compliant Contact Models</h1>

      <p>Most compliant contact models are conceptually straight-forward: we
      will implement contact forces using a stiff spring (and damper) that
      produces forces to resist penetration (and grossly model the dissipation
      of collision and/or friction).  However, the devil is in the details.</p>

      <p>The first detail comes in defining the signed distance function,
      $\phi(\bq)$.  It is natural to define the distance between two objects
      that are not in collision as the smallest Euclidean distance between any
      two points on the bodies, and the distance for two bodies in collision as
      the (negative) maximum penetration depth.  Unfortunately, computing the
      penetration depth for arbitrary bodies is a very complex numerical
      geometry problem, and is generally considered too expensive to be
      computed exactly inside, for instance, a simulation loop.</p>

      <p>The second detail is about where we should put the spring/dampers. One
      candidate would be to add a spring along the line of maximal penetration,
      but even if one could compute it accurately this line might not be
      unique, and can move discontinuously with small changes in $\bq$. (This
      is one of the reasons that simulated robots can "explode" in a number of
      modern simulators; as we will see the time-stepping methods can have the
      same pitfall).  Also a single point force cannot capture effects like
      torsional friction, and performs badly in some very simple cases (imaging
      a box sitting on a table).  As a result, many of the most effective
      algorithms for contact restrict themselves to very limited/simplified
      geometry.  For instance, one can place "point contacts" (zero-radius
      spheres) in the four corners of a robot's foot; in this case adding
      forces at exactly those four points as they penetrate some other
      body/mesh can give more consistent contact force locations/directions. A
      surprising number of simulators, especially for legged robots, do
      this.</p>

      <p>In practice, most collision detection algorithms will return a list of
      "collision point pairs" given the list of bodies (with one point pair per
      pair of bodies in collision, or more if they are using the aforementioned
      "multi-contact" heuristics), and our contact force model simply attaches
      springs between these pairs. Given a point-pair, $p_A$ and $p_B$, both in
      world coordinates, ...</p>

      <todo>Some diagrams could help a LOT here.</todo>

      <p>For this simple case, we can define the normal force direction as...
      the frictional force as... and write a spring-law...</p>

      <p>In order to tightly approximate the (nearly) rigid contact that most
      robots make with the world, the stiffness of these springs must be quite
      high.  For instance, I might want my 180kg humanoid robot model to
      penetrate into the ground no more than 1mm during steady-state standing.
      The challenge with adding stiff springs to our model is that this results
      in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_equation">stiff
      differential equations</a> (it is not a coincidence that the word
      <em>stiff</em> is the common term for this in both springs and ODEs). As
      a result, the best implementations of compliant contact for simulation
      must use stiff ODE solvers, and these models are often difficult or
      impossible to use in e.g. trajectory/feedback optimization.</p>

      <p>Some of the advantages of this approach include (1) the fact that it
      is easy to implement, at least for simple geometries, (2) by virtue of
      being a continuous-time model it can be simulated with error-controlled
      integrators, and (3) the tightness of the approximation of "rigid"
      contact can be controlled through relatively intuitive parameters.</p>

    </subsection>

    <subsection><h1>Rigid Contact with Event Detection</h1>

      <subsubsection><h1>Impulsive Collisions</h1>

        <p>The collision event is described by the zero-crossings (from
        positive to negative) of $\phi$. Let us start by assuming frictionless
        collisions, allowing us to write \begin{equation}\bM\ddot{\bq} = \btau
        + \Phi^T \lambda,\end{equation} where $\Phi = \pd{\phi}{\bq}$ and
        $\lambda \ge 0$ is now a (scalar) impulsive force that is well-defined
        when integrated over the time of the collision (denoted $t_c^-$ to
        $t_c^+$).  Integrate both sides of the equation over that
        (instantaneous) interval: \begin{align*}\int_{t_c^-}^{t_c^+} dt\left[
        \bM \ddot{\bq} \right] = \int_{t_c^-}^{t_c^+} dt \left[ \btau + \Phi^T
        \lambda \right] \end{align*} Since $\bM$, $\btau$, and $\bPhi$ are
        constants over this interval, we are left with $$\bM\dot{\bq}^+ -
        \bM\dot{\bq}^- = \Phi^T \int_{t_c^-}^{t_c^+} \lambda dt,$$ where
        $\dot{\bq}^+$ is short-hand for $\dot{\bq}(t_c^+)$. Multiplying both
        sides by $\Phi \bM^{-1}$, we have $$ \Phi \dot{\bq}^+ - \Phi\dot{\bq}^-
        = \Phi \bM^{-1} \Phi^T \int_{t_c^-}^{t_c^+} \lambda dt.$$ After the
        collision, we have $\dot\phi^+ = -e \dot\phi^-$, with $0 \le e \le 1$
        denoting the <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_restitution">coefficient
        of restitution</a>, yielding: $$ \Phi \dot{\bq}^+ - \Phi\dot{\bq}^- =
        -(1+e)\Phi\dot{\bq}^-,$$ and therefore $$\int_{t_c^-}^{t_c^+} \lambda
        dt = - (1+e)\left[ \Phi \bM^{-1} \Phi^T \right]^+ \Phi \dot{\bq}^-.$$
        Substituting this back in above results in \begin{equation}\dot{\bq}^+
        = \left[ \bI - (1+e)\bM^{-1} \Phi^T \left[ \Phi \bM^{-1} \Phi^T
        \right]^+ \Phi \right] \dot{\bq}^-.\end{equation}</p>

        <p>We can add friction at the contact.  Rigid bodies will almost always
        experience contact at only a point, so we typically ignore torsional
        friction <elib>Featherstone06</elib>, and model only tangential
        friction by replacing $\Phi$ with a matrix $\bJ$ that has $\Phi$ as one
        row, but two additional rows to capture the gradient of the contact
        location tangent to the contact surface, written in joint coordinates
        (c.f. <elib>Stewart96</elib>). Then $\blambda$ becomes a Cartesian
        force vector, but the equations above remain unchanged. If $\blambda$
        is restricted to a friction cone, as in Coulomb friction, in general we
        have to solve an optimization to solve for $\dot\bq^+$ subject to the
        inequality constraints. </p>

      </subsubsection>

      <subsubsection><h1>Putting it all together</h1>

        <p> We can put the bilateral constraint equations and the impulsive
        collision equations together to implement a hybrid model for unilateral
        constraints of the form. Let us generalize \begin{equation}\bphi(\bq)
        \ge 0,\end{equation} to be the vector of all pairwise (signed) distance
        functions between rigid bodies; this vector describes all possible
        contacts. At every moment, some subset of the contacts are active, and
        can be treated as a bilateral constraint ($\bphi_i=0$). The guards of
        the hybrid model are when an inactive constraint becomes active
        ($\bphi_i>0 \rightarrow \bphi_i=0$), or when an active constraint
        becomes inactive ($\blambda_i>0 \rightarrow \blambda_i=0$ and
        $\dot\phi_i > 0$). Note that collision events will (almost always) only
        result in new active constraints when $e=0$, e.g. we have pure
        inelastic collisions, because elastic collisions will rarely permit
        sustained contact.</p>

        <p>If the contact involves Coulomb friction, then the transitions
        between sticking and sliding can be modeled as additional hybrid
        guards, or can be solved efficiently as a complementarity problem

  <section><h1>Recursive Dynamics Algorithms</h1>

    <p>The equations of motions for our machines get complicated quickly.
    Fortunately, for robots with a tree-link kinematic structure, there are very
    efficient and natural recursive algorithms for generating these equations of
    motion.  For a detailed reference on these methods, see
    <elib>Featherstone07</elib>; some people prefer reading about the
    Articulated Body Method in <elib>Mirtich96</elib>.  The implementation in
    <drake></drake> uses a related formulation from <elib>Jain11</elib>.</p>
